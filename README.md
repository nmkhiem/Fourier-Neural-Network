# Fourier Neural Network
 
Testing Fourier Neural Operator for High dimensional Equation. 

Compared with PINNs, Fourier Network approximates high-frequency PDEs equations more effectively. It can even perform well with very few data points, including noisy data. However, the installation part is quite complicated and the training time is super long.
